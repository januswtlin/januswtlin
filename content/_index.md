title: Hi, there
---

My name is Janus Lin. I"m from Taiwan and currently live in Bangkok, Thailand.

I'm a software engineer focusing on data pipeline, mining, and machine learning. Before I jumped into the data rabbit hole, I mainly worked as a backend developer. I'm lucky to have experience working in startups and international corporates, allowing me to join many projects in different areas.

I'm also a big fan of specialty coffee. I'm super proud that I make a cup of delicious filter coffee for my wife and myself every morning. Hopefully, I'll share more about what I've learned about coffee, the tasty coffee I've drunk, and the fantastic coffee shops I've been to.

Lately, I learned the concept of the Digital Garden. It's a fascinating idea. I started this website as my digital garden, where I can plant seeds of ideas and cultivate my thoughts constantly.Â
