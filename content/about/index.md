## About Me

Hi, My name is Janus Lin. I'm a software engineer from Taiwan. I moved to Bangkok, Thailand, in 2017 and have been working with [Agoda](~https://www.agoda.com/~) since then.

For most of my career, I have been working as a backend software engineer. However, I have been working in data mining since 2020. The latest project gives me many opportunities to learn about big data processing and data pipelines. 

Beyond the profession, I am also a coffee aficionado and a diver. I embrace and enjoy all aspects of coffee, from coffee agriculture to a cup of coffee on the table. This year (2024), I learned a new skill: scuba diving. Now, I canâ€™t wait to dive and see all the beautiful dive sites.

Those are important things in my life. Iâ€™ll keep the most important people in person ðŸ˜‰.
