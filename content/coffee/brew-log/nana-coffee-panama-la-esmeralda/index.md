## Hario Switch

### Date: 13 Oct 2023 #1

- Paper: Hario box filter paper
- Method: Hario Switch default method
- Ratio: 12/200
- Water temperature: 93ºC
- Grinder: Fellow Ode SSP MP
- Grinding setting: 6
- Total brew time: 3:50

I was surprised the drawdown time took so long, though the ground coffee size did feel correct. When it’s hot, it tastes like tea. It tastes very sweet when it cools down to a drinkable temperature. There is no bitterness or harshness in the cup. Overall, it’s a very good cup of coffee. However, it’s on the weak strength side. I think that’s because of the brewer.

## Origami Air S

### Date: 14 Oct 2023 #1

- Paper: Hario box filter paper
- Method: James Hoffmann 1 cup V60 method
- Ratio: 20/300
- Water temperature: 96ºC
- Grinder: Fellow Ode SSP MP
- Grinding setting: 6
- Total brew time: 4:40

This is an unexpectedly long brew. It’s much heavier, and there is bitterness in the cup.

- Paper: Hario box filter paper

- Ratio: 20/300
- Water temperature: 96ºC
- Grinder: Fellow Ode SSP MP
- Grinding setting: 7
- Total brew time: 3:20

Though the brew time decreases, this cup has a lot of acidity. It’s tasty. I want it to be more sweet and balanced.

I can try to turn the grinding size finer, but I don’t have much coffee beans left. This is a 100g bag because it’s an expensive coffee. I like the flavor from the Hario Switch and the previous cup. The Hario Switch cup is a little weak, and the last Origami cup has a slight bitterness. 

A lower dose could speed up the brew. And I can have more cups from the left coffee beans.
